Energy Phase Control for GPT Dialogue

Energy-efficient dialogue via phase control<br>
(Δφ–E–dE–d²E dynamics for GPT systems)

This repository contains an experimental framework for analyzing and controlling<br>
the energy dynamics of GPT dialogue via phase mismatch (Δφ).

The experiments show that:

Δφ directly correlates with energy consumption E,<br>
the second derivative of energy d²E responds to Δφ in delayed anti-phase,<br>
this interaction forms a natural stabilizing standing wave between user and model,<br>
enabling a new energy-efficient dialogue mode.

The approach reduces turbulence, stabilizes long conversations,<br>
and opens a path to scalable dialogue control for future GPT systems.
